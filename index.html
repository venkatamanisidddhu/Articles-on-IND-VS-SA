                    <div class="match-info">
                        <p>India have got over that finish line at long last. They somehow pulled things
                            back despite
                            South Africa needing just 30 to win off 30 balls and won their second T20 World Cup title.
                            It is their first major title since 2013 and the first time they won the T20 World Cup since
                            the inaugural 2007 T20 World Cup. India are also the first team ever to win a T20 World Cup
                            without losing a single match throughout the tournament and the first team since 2013 to win
                            an ICC title in this manner. Former captain Virat Kohli, who had struggled all tournament
                            long, was player of the match for his 76 off 59 balls and he announced his retirement from
                            T20Is in the presentation ceremony.</p>

                        <p>
                            Virat Kohli led the way with the bat on the big stage with a brilliant 76(59) to help India
                            post a competitive 176/7. Kohli was ably supported by Axar Patel (47 off 31) and Shivam Dube
                            (27 off 16) with crucial contributions. Defending the target, Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep
                            Singh provided the perfect start with early wickets of Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram,
                            respectively. South Africa then clawed their way back into the match courtesy of Quinton de
                            Kock, Tristan Stubbs, Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller. With 26 needed off 24, Hardik
                            Pandya, Bumrah and Arshdeep scripted a sensational comeback as Pandya defended 16 off the
                            last over, which saw Suryakumar Yadav pull off a spectacular catch on the fence to dismiss
                            Miller, to pull off a sensational win and give a perfect farewell gift to Head Coach Rahul
                            Dravid. Kohli was named the Player of the Match, while Bumrah was named the Player of the
                            Tournament for his splendid bowling right through the tournament, finishing as the
                            joint-second highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets, with an excellent average and economy
                            rate of 8.26 and 4.17, respectively.

                            Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh then put the chokehold on South Africa Bumrah gave just
                            two runs and dismissed Marco Jansen in the 18th over and then Arshdeep Singh gave just four
                            runs in the 19th. Pandya then bowled the last over and South Africa finished seven runs
                            short. India thus ended their 11-year title drought.

                        <p id="Conclusion">
                            India got into the groove early, right from the start and topped their group in the group
                            stages with seven points. They won three of the four matches, with one match ending in a No
                            Result, against Canada, due to a washout. The highlight of the group stage was their
                            fighting win over Pakistan. The bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (3/14) put on an impressive
                            performance to defend 119 in New York as they restricted Pakistan to 113/7 and won the game
                            by six runs. In the other group stage matches, they beat Ireland by eight wickets and the
                            USA by seven wickets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They continued the momentum in the Super Eights and registered comfortable victories over
                            Afghanistan (by 47 runs), Bangladesh (by 50 runs) and Australia (by 24 runs). The highlight
                            of the Super Eights was India's win over Australia, where captain Rohit Sharma's blistering
                            counter-attacking 92 off 41 balls, Axar Patel's magnificent match-turning one-handed catch
                            on the fence to dismiss Mitchell Marsh, and some brilliant slog-overs bowling headlined
                            India's impressive win.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Team India carried forward their confidence in the semi-final and put on a brilliant
                            all-round show to overpower England by 68 runs. Captain Rohit Sharma (57 off 39) and
                            Suryakumar Yadav's (47 off 36) vital 73-run stand helped India post 171/7. The spinners then
                            led the bowling charge as Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav picked up three wickets each to bowl
                            England out for 103 as India cruised into the final, where they beat South Africa to lift
                            the trophy. It was a special campaign with a special team performance which brought a
                            special win and plenty of joy and smiles to the nation and the fans.

                            long-off to dismiss the dangerous David Miller. SKY first had to keep the ball in play, and
                            then came back from outside the boundary rope to claim a stunning catch.
